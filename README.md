# One-max problem

The one-max problem is a basic problem.

Given a bit string of  0's and 1's, the aim is to find a bit string which contains the most 1's.

# Usage

Open terminal

    make
    
1. Run directly in the terminal by typing the following:

        #./main [algo] [runs] [iter] [bits] [filename] [population] [Pc] [Pm]
        ./main ga 30 1000 100 "" 20 0.08 0.78
    
2. Or if you want to run multiple times, just by opening the "search.sh" and add whatever you want and run by typing


        ./search.sh
    in the terminal.
    
# Customize

You can change the iteration block by modifying 

        const int block=10;
in "execute.hpp".
